		<b>Enzymes</b> are <strong>proteins</strong>, chains of amino acids that polymerize, connect together in repeating units, into polypeptides, but a protein may also consit of one large polypeptide chain. Your proteins are from Unit 1, from the class of macromolecules, with lipids and carbohydrates being the other two major classes. These proteins are ubiquitous, they are <u>found throughout every organ of your body and they help in a plethora of ways and activities</u>. To note, enzymes are made by your body, and anything automatically made by your body is called an endogenous product, or endogenous for short. Any endogenous process occurs natrually apart of the lifeform. In other words, you do not easily receive enzymes from outside your body unless given to you in the form of medicine. For nearly all enzymes, they will follow an <em>-ase</em> name formatting (a nomenclature), but some of the first few enzymes follow the -in name formatting for proteins.

		Enzymes are critical for life and functionality. Whenever a scientist says that something is critical to the existence or life of an organism, whether that organism be a turtle, penguin, or lion, they mean that the organism will not and cannot survive without it; it's a fundametnal part of life. Proteins makeup the vast majority of biomass on the planet Earth, and there is often one single enzyme for each protein. There can be enzymes for enzymes, enzymes for carrier proteins, enzymes for transporting proteins, and enzymes for any other protein, and your carbohydrates and lipids. In fact, chrbodyhrases perform enzymatic functions for carbohydrates, and lipases perform enzymatic functions for lipids.

		Listed here are the key parts of this lesson.
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Lock-and-Key Model - the active site of an enzyme precisely fits a specific substrate.</li>
				<li>Induced Fit - only the proper susbtrate is capable of causing a change in the steric arrangement of atoms making up the protein molecule along the active site.</li>
				<li>Reaction Energy &#9889;- reactions follow both exothermic (energy exiting) and endothermic (energy entering) events within the cell. Your molecules need energy and they give off energy often as a result of their reactions.</li>
			</ul>

		<table border="2" align="center" alt="This table shows factors affecting enzymatic activity; there are multiple factors affecting how enzymes funciton and three major ones are temperature, acidity levels, and concentration of regulators. To note, acidity levels are often well-regulated in the body.">
		
			<tr>
				<td align="center" scope="col" colspan="2"><h2> Factors Affecting Enzymatic Activity</h2></td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Temperature</th>
				<td> Optimal temperature ranges are critical for enzymes to function.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Acidity Levels (pH levels)</th>
				<td> pH levels can vary throughout the body and across organelles. For example, the pH of organs such as the brain and liver range from 7.2-7.4; they are mostly water, and enzymes in these organs have a swift breakdown if this range changes <i>even just by a little bit</i>.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Time</th>
				<td> Realistically, enzymes do not function in a flash, they require time. For example, the eyes requrie enzymes to help them to see after looking at a source of light, no matter how bright.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Concentration of Regulators</th>
				<td> Allosteric regulators, activators and inhibitors, will affect the total enzymatic activity seen in a part of the cell or body.*</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Presence of Coenzymes</th>
				<td> Molecules that aid your enzymes in completing a chemical reaction or they will help to construct part of the active site on your enzymes.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Concentration of Enzymes/Substrates</th>
				<td> Levels of enzymes and/or substrates will determine both the rate at which your enzymes made their products and the amount of products at the end of their activity.</td>
			</tr>

		*Enzymes can have different forms, and they need to oscillate between these different forms. <b>Allosteric Regulation</b>  is the effectiv emanagement of the protein via binding of either an activator or an inhibitor molecule. Both molecules, whether they are an activtor or an  inhbitor, can cause a <i>conformational change</i>, a change in the shape, of the enzyme. Activators will bind to and active site, and just by doing that, they can cause all other parts of the enzyme to open up, and those new active sites can further nab more substrates and produce more products; they will <u>stabilize the active form, and stop it from falling apart, because big proteins tend to shake apart from so much activity</u>. Inhibitors will close up the enzyme, in a manner where the enzyme will hug itself or collapse in on itself. In the inhibited state, enzymes can be reserved and their levels saved until they are needed.<br><sub>Allosteric means "other atoms" in this case, and it comes from Greek rootwords, where allo- means other and steric means arrangment of solids (atoms) in space, so allosteric regulators are other atoms built up in space, the same space that their enzymatic counterparts reside.</sub></br>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Constant activity levels from enzymes is lethal to the cell and tissue of the organism. <b>Feedback inhibition</b> is the process of deactivating a metabolic pathway by interrupting a part of the pathway. Overactive cells lead to catapstrophic results; neurons that never settle after being activated result in seizures, and these seizures can spread to other parts of the brain; purkinje nerve fibers in the heart that do not reset after activating result in zero blood flow, which reduces blood presure throughout the body and increases the difficulty to restarting blood flow in the body. Enzymes that are always active could end up producing massives amounts of <em> radical oxidative speices</em>, molecules that increase the acidity of the cell, and these molecules can damage DNA, causing mutations, or lead to premature cell death.
