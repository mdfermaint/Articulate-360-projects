				<h2>More About the Author</h2>
				
				<p>I lived and grew up in Illinois when I was a child. Later on, I moved to Arizona while I was still young, and have since lived here. I only went back to Illinois, Texas, and other places that I lived in or had family for short periods of time. I grew up as low-functioning autistic, but gradually progressed to high-functioning autism and now most trained professionals cannot tell that I am autistic.</p>

				<p>I began going to college in 2015, at Estrella Mountain Community College, after graduating as valedictorian in highschool in 2014, half-a-year early than most others. I got my Associate's in Science with an emphasis in the general sciences under the Presidents' Scholars program and an award for Service Engagement with Public Institutions, specifically with the Aunt Rita's AIDS Walk Foundation and the Arizona Science Center. I graduated with my A.S. to lock-in my credits, since I got them from an HLC-accredited institution; those credits can and will be accepted anywhere. For some time prior to my first graduation in college, I monitored several learning institutions who offered baccalaurate degrees in neuroscience, and transferred to the University of Arizona to get my B.S. in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science with an overarching emphasis in neuroscience and cognitive science; most of my classes ranged from neurobiology to neurocomputation and modeling to mind and philosophy. I stayed at that learning institution for my Master's of Science in Biomedical Engineering, with a distributed emphasis in biomedical engineering, from surface/material chemistry to wearable electronics and movement/motion.
				<br>During my sophomore year in college, I completed research in the psychology club on the local student body and drug use; the question here was to understand the relationship between students and drug and alcohol use at that campus. I participated in an undergraduate research experience through the Minority Health Disparities program at the University of Arizona, where I learned more about animal rodent surgeries, and collected and analyzed neural and biochemical data with a dopamine-and-neural-activity recording device called DANA; the work here was on testing a new device that would scan for the presence of a macromolecule during a corresponding neural event. In my junior year, I joined a neuropsychophsyiology lab and learned EEG cap application and Matlab data processing for EEG caps; the work here was pure research on neural activity in those with depression. Also, in both my junior and senior years, I worked in a biophysics lab on hyaluronic acid gel scaffolds and neocortical neurons, attempting to fashion a methacrylic anhydride hyaluronic acid gel scaffold; the research question here is simple: make a gel that can instantiate the cellular environment of neurons and allow researchers to modulate the growth rate and projections of the neurons embedded within them while maintaining a high survival rate of plated neurons. Concurrently, I was a preceptor, and later graduate tutor, for a MATLAB course NSCS344: Modeling the Mind. In my fifth year of college, I worked on subdermal and wearable flexible devices; my work guaranteed another graduate student their first grant proposal. I constructed devices from their schematics, to their circuitry, and to the final prototypes. In my sixth year, I worked in a neuropsychology lab with artificial light cycles and circadian rhythms on the model organism drosophila melanogaster. Since graduating with my masterâ€™s of science, I have professionally taught undergraduate courses in chemistry and biology at Grand Canyon University and across the Maricopa Community College District.
